Solutions to [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) problems.

Solutions will not go past [problem 100](https://projecteuler.net/#publish).

Run `npm i` to install.

Run `npm run serve` to get an interactive for solving problems and timing the solution.

Run `npm run solution <#>` to run a specific solution without an interactive or timing.

Library functions use BigInt almost always.

`// optimize:` comments are used for places that I know could be made more efficient and maybe will need to for future problems.
